/*
    <Target> First Index whose "Partner Index" [= Index XOR 1] holds a DIFFERENT Number.
    <Couples> First Number occurs at EVEN Index; Second Number occurs at ODD Index.
    <Disturbance> This PATTERN will be MISSED when a SINGLE Number appears in the Array.
    <Intuition> Focus AWAY from that HALF of the Array which has the Pattern MAINTAINED.
    <Method> Number XOR 1 == Flips the Least Significant Bit of the operand Number.
    <Inference> LSB becomes 0 from 1 == Subtracted 1; LSB becomes 1 from 0 == Added 1.
    <Application> Odd Number XOR 1 = Odd Number - 1; Even Number XOR 1 = Even Number + 1.
